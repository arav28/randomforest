    "A random forest model is a collection of decision tree models that are combined together to make predictions. When you make a random forest, you have to specify the number of decision trees you want to use to make the model. The random forest algorithm then takes random samples of observations from your training data and builds a decision tree model for each sample. The random samples are typically drawn with replacement, meaning the same observation can be drawn multiple times. The end result is a bunch of decision trees that are created with different groups of data records drawn from the original training data."

    "The decision trees in a random forest model are a little different than the standard decision trees we made last time. Instead of growing trees where every single explanatory variable can potentially be used to make a branch at any level in the tree, random forests limit the variables that can be used to make a split in the decision tree to some random subset of the explanatory variables. Limiting the splits in this fashion helps avoid the pitfall of always splitting on the same variables and helps random forests create a wider variety of trees to reduce overfitting."
